          Trabant is a series of small cars produced from 1957 until 1991 by
          former East German car manufacturer VEB Sachsenring Automobilwerke
          Zwickau. They are quite possibly the most car-looking cars imaginable.

          <p>
            For many in the West the Trabant automobile was one of the symbols of the economic differences between Eastern and Western Europe. When the Hungarian government opened its borders in the late summer of 1989, tens of thousands of East German citizens streamed westward, many of them driving or riding in “Trabis” as they were known. While Westerners scoffed at the cars, both because of the Duroplast (plastic) bodies and the smoky, weak engines, for the East German regime, the Trabant was a symbol of modernism and socialist efficiency.
          </p>
          <p>
            From the perspective of those managing the East German economy, the use of plastic material, which in the 1950s was a very modern idea, symbolized the forward-thinking nature of Communist planning. Moreover, the use of Duroplast meant that the government could use its steel production for things other than the manufacture of personal transportation. Ironically, given how many Trabi jokes there were in the 1990s, automobile manufacturers today are using more and more plastic material in cars, both because it is less expensive than steel, and because it does not rust. Also, from the perspective of the central planners in charge of the economy, an automobile was a means of transportation, not an extension of one's personality, and so the many luxury features found in Western cars were completely unnecessary—functionality was what mattered.
          </p>
          <p>
            While the Trabant was intended to be a symbol of the efficiency and forward thinking nature of Communist economic planning, the reality was that East Germans typically had to wait as long as two years, if not longer, to purchase a Trabant because the government was unable to produce the cars fast enough to keep up with demand. Trabants have made a comeback of sorts today, both as collector's items, but also as a concept—small, light, inexpensive, fuel efficient automobiles are very popular items more almost 20 years since the last Trabi rolled off the assembly line—something that must seem ironic to those responsible for creating, building, and maintaining the Trabant in the first place.

            </div>
            <p>The Trabant's 26 horsepower engine is a 594 cc P60-P66 two-stroke L2 with a 4-speed manual and semi-automatic transmission.  The car was front-wheel drive had spark-ignition and took a mixture of gasoline (petrol) with oil as fuel. </p>

            </div>
            <p>The Trabant's dashboard is simplistic. There is no fuel guage and so, the fuel level must be checked under the hood. Zounds! As the car is air cooled, there is also no water temperature gauge. Ee-gads! </p>

            </div>
            <p>The standard tire size of the Trabant is 145 SR 13 with a tire-width of 145 mm. Tire sidewall factor is 82 with the rim size being 13 in. This made for a total wheel diameter of 568 / 22.4 (mm / in)  ... I don't know what any of this means.

            <p>The maximum boot space (tunk size) of a Trabant is 415 l 14.66 cu. ft. That's fine I guess. Actually I really have no idea, I literally chose the topic for this page at random. But it seems like you could have a nice picnic with this thing.
